These are persistent notes of the [OUSPG open](https://github.com/ouspg/ouspg-open) review of [Ilkka Sovanto's pahuus](https://github.com/ouspg/pahuus/blob/master/latex/thesis.pdf) M.Sc. thesis draft on [etherpad](http://muistio.tieke.fi/p/pahuus) [11 reviewers]

# Generic Notes

 * whole scene (based on references) seems somewhat stale
  * -> good opportunity to modernize
   * -> good time to modernize since today "less is more" is fashionable
    * -> simple signatureless detection challenge

 * high priority, find 2-3 easily implementable algorithms to seed the challenge

 * whole thesis could be just a markdown in the repo at this point, then later on paste text to latex when there is more beef?

 * atom.io - Suggested editor with extra zen

 * noids.io? - The signatureless detection challenge
  * Put your code where your mouth is

# Design goals

Testbench framework design goals: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oND8ioqH0r7Wu_9IBc8A2qLK1v60PCxq_Q7EF_NIEo8/edit?usp=sharing

 * would actually be more useful if these were in the repo as Markdown as well, maybe even as part of the main thesis markdown
 * solid design goals, we now should move to think about the actual Minimum Viable Product in practice and get implementing!
  * s[ai]mple data
  * s[ai]mple algo
  * s[ai]mple workflow (docker, CI?)
  * s[ai]mple result collection

 *  Netbench Latest version: 1.8 (2012-08-24) - wonder why it was not adopted (google hits are old as well)
   * http://www.nr2.ufpr.br/~jefferson/pdf/Network_Anomaly_Detection-Methods,_Systems_and_Tools.pdf
     * Be aware.
     * Internal vs external classification - outdated
     * A bit sloppy terminology? (Risk vs vulnerability vs threat)  "For example, a system may be perfectly secure when it is isolated but becomes vulnerable when it is"
 * would actually be more useful if these were in the repo as Markdown as well, maybe even as part of the main thesis markdown
 * Why netbench failed? Or is it just  "complete"?
   * No fresh google hits
    * Not a relevant problem to anyone? (at that time?)

# Meta

 * Passive tone. Debated topic, many journals required active tone already ~2007 (haven't checked the current trend)  
  *  Active tone attributes better who did what - should be important in articles?

# 1. INTRODUCTION

* we vs I?
* lesser known vs less known
