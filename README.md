## Abstract
The idea is to enumerate the state of the art in detecting malware command & control traffic. Do silver bullets exist? Any well-hidden gems? Why are we not seeing products making use of previous research? Are there methods that actually work? Is the code available? Can we reproduce any positive results?

## Project plan, steps
0. Improve project plan
1. Find and list suitable papers, conference presentations & proceedings etc.
2. Filter out the promising ones
3. Identify proposed methods and possible results, consider reproducibility
4. Present findings as a table
5. Reproduce / test some methods against available test datasets
6. Possibly produce test datasets without private information
7. Write the thesis
